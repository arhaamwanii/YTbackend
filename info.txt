to enter mongoDB atlas 
    - two things are required 
    
    - YOUR IP ADRESS SHOULD BE ALLOWED
    - YOU SHOULD HAVE CORRECT ID.PASSWORD

    - proffesionlly the only ip adress is allowed where the backend code is running 
    - so that it can access the data base

        - doing it via a db folder file
            - cleaner
    
    - MONGOOSE - connects with database
    - mongoose.connect
    -> problem will come when connecting with db 
        - try catch -- orr if else
        - promises
    -> data base is always in other conenent 
        - async await 
        - it takes time to conect 

    - not having ; semicolon at the end of the code previous to if-else can cause problems 
        - so it is better to do it at the start of your code
